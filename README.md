#### About

I am a PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, supervised by [Dr. Mor Nitzan](https://www.nitzanlab.com/). I focus on decoding cellular identities in single-cell data, developing computational frameworks to (i) disentangle and reconstruct the multiple facets of cellular identity from single-cell data by filtering known biological signals and applying semi-supervised disentanglement methods, (ii) infer the underlying structure of different biological processes and (iii) model and predict information encoding mechanisms in cells.

I finished my MSc in Physics in 2020 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem advised by Prof. Naftali Tishby and [Prof. Zohar Ringel](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~zohar.ringel/). My thesis was at the interface between information theory and statistical mechanics suggesting a technique for dimensionality reduction. Previously I received my BSc, double major in Physics and Computer Science, from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2018.
