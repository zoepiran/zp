#### About
I recently started my postdoc at Genentech and Stanford, hosted by [Aviv Regev](https://www.roche.com/about/leadership/aviv-regev), and [Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/). I did my PhD at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of [Mor Nitzan](https://www.nitzanlab.com/copy-of-home),
where my research focused on decoding cellular identities in single-cell data to explore axes of biological variation. I developed computational frameworks to disentangle and reconstruct the multifaceted nature of cellular identity by filtering known biological signals and applying semi-supervised disentanglement methods.

I finished my MSc in Physics in 2020 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem advised by [Naftali Tishby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Tishby) and [Zohar Ringel](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~zohar.ringel/). My thesis was at the interface between information theory and statistical mechanics suggesting a technique for dimensionality reduction. Previously I received my BSc, double major in Physics and Computer Science, from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2018.
