#### About

I am a PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, supervised by [Dr. Mor Nitzan](https://www.nitzanlab.com/). I focus on decoding cellular identities in single-cell data, developing computational frameworks to
1. _Disentangle_ and _reconstruct_ the multiple facets of cellular identity from single-cell data by filtering known biological signals and applying semi-supervised disentanglement methods.
2. Infer the _underlying structure_ of different biological processes.
3. Model and predict _information encoding mechanisms_ in cells.

I finished my MSc in Physics in 2020 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem advised by [Prof. Naftali Tishby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Tishby) and [Prof. Zohar Ringel](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~zohar.ringel/). My thesis was at the interface between information theory and statistical mechanics suggesting a technique for dimensionality reduction. Previously I received my BSc, double major in Physics and Computer Science, from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2018.
